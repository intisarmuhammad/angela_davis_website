# Angela Davis Website
All in one Resource website to learn about American political activist, Angela Davis. After reading, listening, and learning, you'll be set to continue the fight for liberation in today's society. We have to honor the work of activists before us and their fight for liberation but our work is never finished. I want this website to provide resources to people who may not have access to higher education or know where to start with Angela Davis’ work. Most of Davis’ revolutionary ideas are represented here so that everyone can be better educated on social justice before participating in movements today.
